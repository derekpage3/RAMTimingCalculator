<p><b>tCL/tCAS - CAS Latency</b></p>

<p>
“The number of cycles between sending a column address to the memory and the beginning of the data in response.<br>
This is the number of cycles it takes to read the first bit of memory from a DRAM with the correct row already<br>
open. Unlike the other numbers, this is not a maximum, but an exact number that must be agreed on between the<br>
memory controller and the memory.”
