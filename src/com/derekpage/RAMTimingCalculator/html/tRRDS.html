<p><b>tRRD - Row to Row Delay or RAS to RAS Delay</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"The amount of cycles that it takes to activate the next bank of memory. It is the opposite of tRAS. The lower the<br>
timing, the better the performance, but it can cause instability."
</p><br>
<p><b>NOTE: </b><b>tRRDS</b> is the version of this timing when activating a bank in a different bank group, and is the<br>
shorter of the two timings</p><br>
