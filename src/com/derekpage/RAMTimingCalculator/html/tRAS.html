<p><b>tRAS - Row Active Time</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"The minimum number of clock cycles required between a row active command and issuing the precharge command.<br>
This is the time needed to internally refresh the row, and overlaps with TRCD. In SDRAM modules, it is simply TRCD + CL.<br>
Otherwise, approximately equal to TRCD + 2×CL."
