<p><b>tRCD - RAS to CAS Delay</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"The minimum number of clock cycles required between opening a row of memory and accessing columns within it. The time<br>
to read the first bit of memory from a DRAM without an active row is TRCD + CL."
</p><br>
<p>Some memory controllers break this down into two values, TRCDwr (write) and TRCDrd (read).</p><br>
