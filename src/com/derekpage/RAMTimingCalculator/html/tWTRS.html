<p><b>tWTR - Write to Read Delay</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"The amount of cycles required between a valid write command and the next read command. Lower is better<br>
performance, but can cause instability."
</p><br>
<p><b>NOTE: </b><b>tWTRS</b> is the version of this timing when doing a write to one bank group and then a read on a<br>
different bank group, and is the shorter of the two timings.</p><br>
