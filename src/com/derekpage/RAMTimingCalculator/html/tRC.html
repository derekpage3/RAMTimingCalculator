<p><b>tRC - Row Cycle Time</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
"The minimum time in cycles it takes a row to complete a full cycle. This can be determined by; tRC = tRAS + tRP.<br>
If this is set too short it can cause corruption of data and if it is too high, it will cause a loss in performance,<br>
but increase stability."
